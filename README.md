# Project5
Done by Liam and Samuel
Did on computer together both in person and online
Used BFT and DFT in code. Watch video


Our program creates a graph represented by 
a - d - g
| \     |
b - e - h
|   | / |
c - f - i

it then performs a BFT and DFT  
the graph is stored in a class with a list of nodes each with their own list of linked nodes representing the edges
